# SARS-COV-2-Virion-Detektor

I have started a project study the feasibility to detect Coronavirus droplets in closed environments using Particle counters + Raman spectroscopy. The details of the project can be found here:
[https://github.com/p4rk3r/sars-cov-2-virion-detektor/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/p4rk3r/sars-cov-2-virion-detektor/blob/master/README.md)

(To be continued).
